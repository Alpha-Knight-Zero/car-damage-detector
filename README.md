This Project has been deployed live at [http://car-damage-detector.vercel.app/](http://car-damage-detector.vercel.app/).

The live website requires that you install the "Moesif Origin & CORS Changer" web extension on your browser from the Chrome Web Store and then enable it. Doing this will make sure that the project can access the backend withour encountering CORS-related issues.

You can also run this on your local machine by following the instructions given below.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
