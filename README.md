This Project has been deployed live at [http://car-damage-detector.vercel.app/](http://car-damage-detector.vercel.app/).

This frontend is built using Nextjs and uses Open-Source CORS-proxy server (developed by me, deployed here:https://cors-proxy-flask.herokuapp.com) as middleware along with Axios.
The backend used is the Open-Source REST API for Car Damage Detection (developed by me, deployed here:https://car-damage-detection1.herokuapp.com/v1/models/car_model).


A demonstration of how this website works id given by a live example shown in the clip below.
